1- First step
acess data to:
	Test
		values
		data type
		shape
	Identify
		outliers
		erros
	Find
		missing values
2- Tabular data
	itens (row), fields(column) and values(cell)
	csv is lightweight
	double quotes for english because of the apostrofe
3- Python
	csv for csv
	xlrd for read excel(xls,xlsx)
	xlwt for write excel(xls,xlsx)

4- Json

5- Procedure
	3 steps:
		1- Build a list with all the values
		2- Download all the data
		3- Parse the data

6- Scraping
	1- look how the browser makes requests
	2- emulate in code
	3- if stuff blows up, look at your http traffic
	4- return to 1 until it works

7- Data Quality
	Measures:
		- Validity:	conforms to a schema (constraints)
		- Accuracy:	conform to a gold standard
		- Completeness:	all records
		- Consistency:	matches other data
		- Uniformity:	same units
	Blueprints:
		- Audit your data
		- Create a data cleaning plan
			- identify causes
			- define operations
			- test
		- Execute the plan
		- Manually correct

8- Mongo DB
	- flexible schema
	- oriented toward programmers
	- flexible deployment
	- designed for big data
	- aggregation framework
	- split the task of cleaning to the task of insert data
	- use json as middle
	- mongoimport -d [database] -c [collection] --file [file.json]

9- Case study
	Blue Print
		- Audit a type of data
		- Develop a plan for cleaning
		- write code to clean
		- back to the beginning
